# 2.8inch Video Player

reference: https://www.quwj.com/2022/08/31/mini-retro-tv.html

This project is based on the ESP32. For the code, I referred to Chen Liangâ€™s work and made modifications on top of it. For example, I changed the resolution to 320x240 and implemented continuous playback functionality. Additionally, I designed a PCB for the project. However, due to a small mistake, I missed a connection near the switch, which prevents the circuit from getting power. Once I have the necessary tools, I will fix it, and I believe this project will become perfect.
